🧠 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

📌 Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a crucial task in marketing and business analytics. This project uses K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to group customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics.

By identifying distinct customer segments, businesses can:

Personalize marketing strategies

Improve customer retention

Optimize product recommendations

Increase overall revenue

🎯 Problem Statement

Businesses often have large volumes of customer data but struggle to extract meaningful insights. Treating all customers the same leads to inefficient marketing and lost opportunities.

Goal:
To segment customers into meaningful groups based on behavioral patterns using machine learning.

🧩 Solution Approach

Load and explore customer data

Perform data preprocessing and scaling

Use the Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters

Apply K-Means Clustering

Visualize customer segments

Interpret clusters for business insights

🛠️ Tech Stack Used
🔹 Programming Language

Python 🐍

🔹 Libraries & Tools

Pandas – Data manipulation

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – K-Means clustering & preprocessing

📊 Key Features

Unsupervised learning using K-Means

Optimal cluster selection using Elbow Method

Visual representation of customer segments

Easy-to-understand clustering insights
