# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

![Customer Segmentation GIF](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7aD2saalBwwftBIY/giphy.gif)

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer Segmentation is a fundamental problem in business analytics and marketing.
This project uses **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic features.

By grouping similar customers together, businesses can design **targeted marketing strategies**, improve customer engagement, and increase profitability.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Businesses often have large customer datasets but lack effective methods to analyze and understand customer behavior. Treating all customers uniformly leads to inefficient marketing and poor decision-making.

**Objective:**
To identify meaningful customer groups using machine learning techniques for better business insights.

---

## 🧩 Solution Approach

* Load and explore customer data
* Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
* Scale numerical features
* Use the **Elbow Method** to find the optimal number of clusters
* Apply **K-Means Clustering**
* Visualize and interpret customer segments

---
